# What is Machine Learning? (total ~20 mins to read)

ðŸ”´ **TODO**
- a brief introduction explain what is machine learning and what we can do by using machine learning methods, can use text + images to illustrate and give an intuition.
- may include history, challenges
- relation to AI and DL (could refer to wikipedia), use a Venn graph

Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalize to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions. Advances in the field of deep learning have allowed neural networks to surpass many previous approaches in performance.

# What will we learn in this TB?

Workshop6: linear regression, loss function, GLM(extra)

Workshop7: decision tree, random forest

Workshop8: SVM, PCA

Workshop9: k-neighbours, unsupervised (ie.k-means)

Workshop10: MLP(lecture) lab: a bit

ðŸ”´ **TODO**: extend the words above to sth other people can read
