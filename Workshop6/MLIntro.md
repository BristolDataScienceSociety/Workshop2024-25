# What is Machine Learning? (total ~20 mins to read)

ðŸ”´ **TODO**:
- a brief introduction explain what is machine learning and what we can do by using machine learning methods, can use text + images to illustrate and give an intuition.
- may include history, challenges
- relation to AI and DL (could refer to wikipedia), use a Venn graph
