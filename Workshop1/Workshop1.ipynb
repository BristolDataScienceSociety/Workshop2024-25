    "## How This Workshop Delivers Knowledge\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop is designed to deliver Python programming knowledge in a **structured and practical** way. It follows a clear progression, starting with **plain Python explanations** and then gradually building up your skills by integrating those concepts into a **real-life scenario**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Python Knowledge Explanation\n",
    "Each section of the workshop introduces core Python concepts, such as data types, variables, operators, loops, and functions. These explanations are kept straightforward and concise, helping you focus on understanding each concept clearly. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why this approach?** Breaking down the basics first allows you to build a strong foundation. Once you understand the essentials, you can more easily apply them to practical situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Real-Life Scenario Integration\n",
    "After explaining each core concept, the workshop immediately challenges you to apply that knowledge in a real-life context: a **Simple Bank Account System**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why use a scenario?** It’s easier to learn when you can see how abstract programming ideas work in practice. By simulating a real-world problem, you reinforce the concepts and develop problem-solving skills that will be valuable beyond this workshop.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Building Knowledge Step-by-Step\n",
    "By alternating between Python explanations and tasks related to the scenario, this workshop helps you **gradually** absorb the material. You won’t just memorize syntax—you’ll understand how to use Python effectively to solve real-world problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "This combination of theory and practice ensures that you leave the workshop with a practical understanding of Python and confidence in applying it."

    "2. **Print Account Details:**\n",

    "   - If the amount is less than or equal to the balance, check for additional conditions:\n",
    "     - **Condition 1:** Check if the withdrawal amount is less than or equal to 500. If true, print a message confirming that the transaction is processed.\n",
    "     - **Condition 2:** If the withdrawal amount is greater than 500 but less than or equal to 1000, print a message that an additional verification is required before processing the transaction.\n",
